## How the Index is Generated

This index is created using the [GitHub Organization Repository Indexer](https://github.com/montge/github-repo-public-indexer):

1. **Phase 1 - Data Collection:**
   - A script queries the GitHub API for all organization repositories
   - Comprehensive metadata is collected (stars, forks, languages, licenses, etc.)
   - Data is saved to `repositories.json`

2. **Phase 2 - Documentation Generation:**
   - The JSON file is processed by an AI assistant (Cursor/Windsurf)
   - A formatted README.md is generated with categorization and organization
   - Manual review and refinement as needed

3. **Publishing:**
   - The updated README.md is committed to this repository
   - Changes are tracked in version control

## Updating the Index Yourself

If you have maintainer access and want to regenerate the index:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- GitHub personal access token with `read:org` scope

### Steps

```bash
# Clone the indexer tool
git clone https://github.com/montge/github-repo-public-indexer.git
cd github-repo-public-indexer

# Install dependencies
./setup.sh
source venv/bin/activate

# Run data collection
python collect_repos.py --org {ORGANIZATION_NAME} --token YOUR_TOKEN --summary

# This generates repositories.json
